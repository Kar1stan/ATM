Java ATM Project - README

Project Overview:
-----------------
This Java-based ATM simulation project provides a simple command-line interface for users to perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, depositing funds, withdrawing money, and exiting the system. It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate object-oriented programming, user input handling, and modular design in Java.

Features:
---------
- User authentication (PIN-based login)
- Balance inquiry
- Deposit and withdrawal functionality
- Transaction history (optional)
- Input validation and error handling
- Modular code structure using classes (e.g., ATM, Account, Transaction)

Technologies Used:
------------------
- Java SE (Standard Edition)
- Console-based I/O (Scanner)
- Object-Oriented Programming principles

Project Structure:
------------------
- ATM.java: App class that handles user interaction and menu navigation
- Account.java: Represents a user's bank account with balance and operations
- Transaction.java: (Optional) Logs and manages transaction history
- Main.java: Entry point to launch the ATM system

How to Run:
-----------
1. Ensure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or higher).
2. Clone or download the project files.
3. Compile the Java files:
   > javac *.java
4. Run the App class:
   > java App
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the ATM system.

Customization:
--------------
- You can modify the initial account balance or add multiple accounts.
- Extend functionality by adding features like fund transfer, account creation, or GUI.
